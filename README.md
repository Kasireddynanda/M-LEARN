# M-LEARN
# Machine Learning Web Application for Students

 # Overview

This web application is designed to help students learn machine learning concepts interactively. It allows users to compare different classifiers on various datasets, visualize results, and understand key ML concepts through an intuitive interface.

# Features

- Upload and select different datasets.
- Compare multiple classifiers such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, etc.
- Evaluate models using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize dataset distributions, decision boundaries, and performance metrics.
- Interactive UI for easy exploration of machine learning concepts.
# Tech Stack

- Frontend: Streamlit / Django (depending on implementation)
- Backend: Django (if used)
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
